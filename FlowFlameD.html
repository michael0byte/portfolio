    <h3><span class="gold">Core</span> Gameplay Mechanics :</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Timer & Scoring System <br> The game features a countdown timer starting at 10 seconds. If the timer reaches 0, the player dies. Simultaneously, a score counter increments by 1 every second, tracking survival time</li>
      &emsp;
      <li>Player Movement & Mask System <br> The player can move left and right, jump, and equip one of three masks. Each mask represents a distinct state, affecting interactions with platforms</li>
      &emsp;
      <li>Dynamic Platform System <br> When the player jumps from one platform to another, a collision box in mid-air triggers an event. This event signals the previous platform to disappear and generates a new platform at a distance equal to the previous platform plus a random offset within a defined range. Platforms are assigned a color randomly from a set of three: green (0), red (1), or blue (2), determining their interaction with the player’s mask</li>
      &emsp;
      <li>Mask-Based Platform Interaction <br> Each platform has a collision box above it. When the player touches it, the system checks which mask is currently equipped</li>
      &emsp;
      <li>If the platform’s color matches the mask state, the player survives and continues the sequence, and also checks the timer: if the remaining time is less than 15 seconds, it adds 5 seconds to the timer, allowing brief survival extensions</li>
      &emsp;
      <li>The player dies if: <br>
1- The timer reaches 0 without extension<br>
2- The player falls off platforms<br>
3- The player lands on a platform without the matching mask equipped</li>
    </ul>
